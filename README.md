<h1> Reflection on Project Management Tools </h1>
<p>Github Collaboration project management features helps developers to collaborate with each other with structured track tasks and understand what to do, how much tasks are in progress, how much completed.
</p>
<p>It also allows to raise an issue of the specific smaller part of the project. The Milestone section of the Github helps in monitoring all the smaller tasks and can be raised with the issue which was mentioned 
  in the issue section. This structured issue and milestone section helps the developer to get clear idea about which issue is a part of the task, ensures better development in the fast paced environment
  for the developers & also to fix the issue within required time period.</p>
<p>The project board is a great feature which helps in assigning task into 3 columns like "To Do", "In progress" & "done" easily. If the issue is assigned instead of tasks, it helps in automatically set the 
  progress of the issue according to 3 different columns. Developers can visualise their workflow accordingly and can manage their time efficienty.</p>
